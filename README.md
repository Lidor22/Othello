The game is a well-known board game invented in 1880.

Originally, the game board is an 8 by 8 matrix (However, its size can be determined).

Each player has their own representative color - black or white.

Each user in his turn adds a coin to the board in such a way that it blocks a sequence of coins from the other player that is blocked from the other side with his own coin, and then the blocked coins turn into their own color.

The winner is the one who has more coins of his color on the board.
